            <h1>Macintosh operating systems</h1>
            <P>"Mac OS" redirects here. For the original Apple operating system for Macs, see Classic Mac OS.
               For the current Apple operating system for Macs, see macOS.<br>The family of Macintosh operating
                systems developed by Apple Inc. includes the graphical user interface-based operating systems it has 
                designed for use with its Macintosh series of personal computers since 1984, as well as the related 
                system software it once created for compatible third-party systems.
<br>
               In 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the "Classic" Mac OS with its release 
               of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded "Mac OS" in 1996, was preinstalled on 
               every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. Noted for its
                ease of use, it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.
            
               <br>
               The current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named "Mac OS X" until 2012 and then "OS X" until 
               2016. Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT, Mac OS X brought an entirely new
                architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the
                 classic Mac OS faced. The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually. It is
                  the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices – iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
      
               <br>
               Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X, Apple experimented with several other concepts, releasing different
                products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa,
                 A/UX, MAE, and MkLinux. Apple's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS 
                 in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects, code named Star Trek, Taligent, and Copland.
               <br>
               Although they have different architectures, the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI 
               principles, including a menu bar across the top of the screen; the Finder shell, featuring a desktop
                metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and 
                file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can; and overlapping windows for multitasking.</P>

                   <h3><B>Classic Mac OS</B></h3>
                   <P>The "classic" Mac OS is the original Macintosh operating system that was introduced in 1984 
                     alongside the first Macintosh and remained in primary use on Macs until the introduction of Mac 
                     OS X in 2001.
<br>
                    Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984; its early system software was partially 
                    based on the Lisa OS and the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs previewed.
                    [6] It was originally named "System Software", or simply "System"; Apple rebranded it as "Mac OS" in 
                    1996 due in part to its Macintosh clone program that ended a year later.
                    <br>
                    Classic Mac OS is characterized by its monolithic design. Initial versions of the System Software run
                     one application at a time. System 5 introduced cooperative multitasking. System 7 supports 32-bit 
                     memory addressing and virtual memory, allowing larger programs. Later updates to the System 7 enable
                      the transition to the PowerPC architecture. The system was considered user-friendly, but its
                       architectural limitations were critiqued, such as limited memory management, lack of protected 
                       memory and access controls, and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions.</P>

    <h3><B>Version</B></h3>
    <P>Nine major versions of the classic Mac OS were released. The name "Classic" that now signifies the system
       as a whole is a reference to a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X.</P>

         <h3><B>Mac OS X / OS X / macOS</B></h3>     
         <P>macOS (originally named "Mac OS X" until 2012 and then "OS X" until 2016)[10] is the current Mac 
           operating system that officially succeeded the classic Mac OS in 2001.
<br>
          Although the system was originally marketed as simply "version 10" of Mac OS, it has a history that is largely
           independent of the classic Mac OS. It is a Unix-based operating system[11][12] built on NeXTSTEP and other 
           technology developed at NeXT from the late 1980s until early 1997, when Apple purchased the company and its 
           CEO Steve Jobs returned to Apple.[13] Precursors to the original release of Mac OS X include OpenStep, Apple's
           repsody project, and the Mac OS X Public Beta.
    <br>      
          macOS makes use of the BSD codebase and the XNU kernel,[14] and its core set of components is based upon Apple's 
          open source Darwin operating system.
        <br>  
          macOS is the basis for some of Apple's other operating systems, including iPhone OS/iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and 
          tvOS.</P> <img src="MacOS1.jpg"  alt="mac os"> 
          <h3><B>Version</B></h3>
          <P>The first desktop version of the system was released on March 24, 2001, supporting the Aqua user interface.
             Since then, several more versions adding newer features and technologies have been released. Since 2011, 
             new releases have been offered on an annual basis.</P>
