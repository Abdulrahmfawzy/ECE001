    <h1>Microsoft Windows</h1>
    
    <p><b>Microsoft Windows</b>, commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of several proprietary graphical operating 
        system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector
         of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may
          encompass subfamilies, (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact) (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft
           Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone.

        Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical
         operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
         .Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal
          computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.
        <br>
        <br>
        Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular 
        operating system in all countries.However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall 
        operating system market to Android, because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. 
        In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold. This comparison,
         however, may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms. 
         Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to competitors) 
        show one third market share, similar to that for end user use.
        <br>
        <br>
        As of October 2020, the most recent version of Windows for PCs, tablets and embedded devices is Windows 10,
         version 21H1. The most recent version for server computers is Windows Server, version 21H1. A specialized 
         version of Windows also runs on
         the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S video game consoles.</p>

<h2>marketing role</h2>

   <p>Microsoft, the developer of Windows, has registered several trademarks, each of which denotes
 a family of Windows operating systems that target a specific sector of the computing industry. As of 2014, 
 the following Windows families were being actively developed:</p>    
 <li>Windows NT: Started as a family of operating systems with Windows NT 3.1, an operating system for server
         computers and workstations. It now consists of three operating system subfamilies 
     that are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released almost at the same time and share the same kernel:
     <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The operating system for mainstream personal computers, tablets and smartphones. 
     The latest version is Windows 10. The main competitor of this family is macOS by Apple for personal computers
      and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android for mobile devices (c.f. Usage share of operating systems § Market share by category).
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.Windows Server: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is Windows Server
          2019. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this 
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family is 
          Linux. (c.f. Usage share of operating systems § Market share by category)
          <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Windows PE: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a live operating 
         system, used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recovery or
          troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.  </li>
  
     <li>Windows IoT (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed Windows CE as a general-purpose 
         operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer. Eventually
         , however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which 
         also consists of Windows Embedded Industry, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 
         Embedded Professional, Windows Embedded Standard, Windows 
         Embedded Handheld, and Windows Embedded Automotive.</li> 
         
    <h2>The following Windows families are no longer being developed:</h2>     

   <li>Windows 9x: An operating system that targeted the consumer market. Discontinued because of suboptimal
      performance. (PC World called its last version, Windows Me, one of the worst products 
      of all time.) Microsoft now caters to the consumer market with Windows NT.</li>
   <li>Windows Mobile: The predecessor to Windows Phone, it was a mobile phone operating system. 
          The first version was called Pocket PC 2000; the third version, Windows Mobile 2003 is the first
           version to adopt the Windows Mobile trademark. The last version is Windows Mobile 6.5.</li>
    
   <li>Windows Phone: An operating system sold only to manufacturers of smartphones. The first version was Windows Phone 
     7, followed by Windows Phone 8, and Windows Phone 8.1. It was succeeded by Windows 10 Mobile, that is now also
      discontinued.</li>


  <h2>Version history</h2>    
  <h3><b>Early versions</b></h3>
  <p>Main articles: Windows 1.0, Windows 2.0, and Windows 2.1x 
    The history of Windows dates back to 1981 when Microsoft started work on a program called "Interface Manager".
     It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name "Windows", 
     but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985. Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system,
      but achieved little popularity. Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS. The shell 
      of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive. Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, 
      Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow
       overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows.
        Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C development environment, which included 
        numerous windows samples.
<br>
    Windows 2.0 was released in December 1987, and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several
     improvements to the user interface and memory management. Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows 
     to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging 
     infringement on Apple's copyrights. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and 
     could make use of expanded memory.
    <br>
    Windows 2.1 was released in two different versions: Windows/286 and Windows/386. Windows/386 uses the virtual 8086
     mode of the Intel 80386 to multitask several DOS programs and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory
      using available extended memory. Windows/286, in spite of its name, runs on both Intel 8086 and Intel 80286
       processors. It runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area.
    <br>
    In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software 
    from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.
    <br>
    The early versions of Windows are often thought of as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS
     and use it for file system services. However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical
      operating system functions; notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device
       drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute
        multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an
         elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than 
         available memory: code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data
          segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.

 <h3><b>Windows 3.x</b></h3>
 <p>Windows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual 
 device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.
  Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several megabytes 
 of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They run inside the same address
  space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection. Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user 
  interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows 
  version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.
<br>
 Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups,
  a special version with integrated peer-to-peer networking features and a version number of 3.11, was released. 
  It was sold along with Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.
 <br>
 Windows 3.2, released 1994, is an updated version of the Chinese version of Windows 3.1. The update was limited
  to this language version, as it fixed only issues related to the complex writing system of the Chinese language.
   Windows 3.2 was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten-disk version of MS-DOS that also had Simplified 
   Chinese characters in basic output and some translated utilities. <img src="Windows_3.0_workspace.png" alt="windows 3.0"></p>

<h3><b>Windows 9x</b></h3>
<p>The next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995. While still remaining MS-DOS-based,
     Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up
      to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented 
      user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell. Windows 95 was a major 
      commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that "by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, 
      it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world." Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95,
       each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack. The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled 
       with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer.Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support 
       for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.
       <br>

    Windows 95 was followed up with the release of Windows 98 on June 25, 1998, which introduced the Windows Driver Model, support for USB
     composite devices, support for ACPI, hibernation, and support for multi-monitor configurations. Windows 98 also included integration
      with Internet Explorer 4 through Active Desktop and other aspects of the Windows Desktop Update (a series of enhancements to the Explorer
       shell which were also made available for Windows 95). In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of 
       Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added Internet Explorer 5.0 and Windows Media Player 6.2 amongst other upgrades. Mainstream support for Windows
       ended on June 30, 2002, and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.
    <br>
    On September 14, 2000, Microsoft released Windows Me (Millennium Edition), the last DOS-based version of Windows. Windows Me incorporated 
    visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions 
    (which however, required the removal of the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs)
    , expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework 
    for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, 
    and updated home networking tools. However, Windows Me was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware 
    compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows Me to be one of the worst operating systems 
    Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.</p>


    <h3><B>Windows NT</B></h3>
    <p>In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave 
        Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as "NT OS/2". NT OS/2 
        was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive 
        multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT
         development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those 
         of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to 
         the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development
          continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately 
          continued OS/2 development on its own.
          <br>

        Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel. The hybrid kernel was designed as a modified microkernel,
         influenced by the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon University, but without meeting all of the criteria 
         of a pure microkernel.
        <br>
        The first release of the resulting operating system, Windows NT 3.1 (named to associate it with Windows 3.1) was released in July 1993,
         with versions for desktop workstations and servers. Windows NT 3.5 was released in September 1994, focusing on performance 
         improvements and support for Novell's NetWare, and was followed up by Windows NT 3.51 in May 1995, which included additional 
         improvements and support for the PowerPC architecture. Windows NT 4.0 was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface
          of Windows 95 to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0. The Windows NT name
           was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand</p>
       <h3><B>Windows XP</B></h3> 
       <P>The next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released on October 25, 2001. The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify 
           the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would
            provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors. Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including
             an updated Start menu and a "task-oriented" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer
              6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous 
              versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality.
<br>
        At retail, Windows XP was now marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition was targeted towards consumers, while the 
        "Professional" edition was targeted towards business environments and power users, and included additional security and networking
         features. Home and Professional were later accompanied by the "Media Center" edition (designed for home theater PCs, with an emphasis
          on support for DVD playback, TV tuner cards, DVR functionality, and remote controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed for 
          mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer, with support for stylus pen input and additional pen-enabled 
          applications). Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.
        <br>
        After Windows 2000, Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems; the server counterpart of Windows XP,
         Windows Server 2003, was released in April 2003. It was followed in December 2005, by Windows Server 2003 R2.</P>  
         
         <h3><B>Windows Vista</B></h3>
         <p>After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30,
              2007, for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical
               changes, with a particular focus on security features. It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject
                to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement. Vista's 
                server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.</p>


           <h3><B>Windows 7</B></h3>   
           <P>On July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released as RTM (release to manufacturing) while the 
               former was released to the public 3 months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which
                introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows
                 line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible.
                 Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar, a home networking system called
                  HomeGroup, and performance improvements.</P>  

                  <H3><b>Windows 8 and 8.1</b></H3>
                  <P>Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant 
                      changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro 
                      design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include
                       the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display 
                       of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices.
                        The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, effectively making it unfit for netbooks
                         with 800×600-pixel screens.
<br>
                    Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks 
                    and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software 
                    distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update
                     to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile 
                     sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 have been subject to some
                      criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.</P>


                  <h3><b>Windows 10</b></h3>
                  <P>On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29,
                       2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes on PC include the 
                       return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the 
                       desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 
                       with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) 
                       or Windows Update (Windows 7).
<br>
                    In February 2017, Microsoft announced the migration of its Windows source code repository from Perforce to Git.
                    This migration involved 3.5 million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository. By May 2017, 90 percent of its 
                    engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.</P>
